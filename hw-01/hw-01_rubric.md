# CMSE 202 - Homework 1 Rubric

In this homework assignment, students are primarily expected to brush up on their
Python skills. They also need to set up a Git repo and practice tracking their
changes. As part of working with their Python skills, the student code up a simple
model for wealth distribution and then they turn this model into a script.

The total number of points possible in this assignment is: **25**

## Part 1: Setting up the git repo and tracking changes (5 points)

* The student should receive:
  - **1 point** for successfully creating a Git repository and committing the
  initial notebook to GitHub.
  - **1 point** for each one of the **3** required commits outlined in the assignment.
  - **1 point** for ensuring the the repository is private and that the instructors
  have been correctly added.

## Part 2: Debugging code (6 points)

* The student should receive:
  - **1 point** for correctly debugging each of the **6** bugs.

## Part 3: Modeling Population Growth (14 points)

### 3.1: The simplest model (4 points)

* The student should receive:
  - **2 points** for a working model.
  - **1 point** for a correct graph.
  - **2 points** for computing correct population value

### 3.2 Scripting more sophisticated model (5 points)

* The student should receive:
  - 
  - **2 points** for having the correct new model.
  - **1 point** for a correct graph.
  - **2 points** for computing correct population value

### 3.3 Comparison ( 5 points)

* The student should receive
  * **3 points** for having working script that executes
  * **2 points** for a graph of all the data
